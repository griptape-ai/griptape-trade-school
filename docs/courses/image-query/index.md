## Course Description
Today, we’re going to create something useful for anyone juggling digital content: a Griptape workflow that processes a directory full of images, and outputs a text file for each. These aren't just any text files—they're packed with things like SEO descriptions, keywords, alt-text, captions, and even a HTML snippet. If you don’t know what any of that means – that’s totally fine, I might’ve had to research some terms myself…

### What is SEO?
First, let’s talk about SEO, which stands for **Search Engine Optimization**. Don’t get this confused with the *Spaghetti Enthusiast Organization*. That route will lead to very different pasta-bilities. The real SEO is the art of tweaking your content so that it’s more understandable and attractive to search engines like Google. Why is this important? Well, good SEO can make the difference between your content remaining unseen and it reaching the wide audience it deserves. 

### Using an LLM
By using an LLM, or Large Language Model, to automate this, we're not just saving heaps of time; we're also harnessing sophisticated AI to generate nuanced and effective text that can boost your search rankings.

So, stick around as we dive into how this Griptape workflow can transform your digital assets into SEO gold, making your content work smarter, not harder.
