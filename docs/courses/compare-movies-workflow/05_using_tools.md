# Using Tools

## Overview
We added flexibility in the last section to allow our application to handle an undefined number of movies. The workflow hierarchy looks like:

``` mermaid
graph TB
    A(Movie Descriptions) --> B("PromptTask: Movie Task 1") --> I("PromptTask: Compare")
    A --> G("PromptTask: Movie Task <i>n</i>" ):::dash
    G --> I
    classDef dash stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    classDef tool stroke:#f06090

```

However, the comparisons coming back don't feel very deep and meaningful. We'd like to get a more detailed analysis of the film comparisons by getting a better summary of each film from the web. 

To do that we'll use add a `ToolkitTask` to our workflow for each movie. This will result in the following chart.
.

So in this section, we'll make our application more flexible by defining a **list** of movie descriptions, and then **iterate** through that list to create PromptTasks and insert them into the workflow.

``` mermaid
graph TB
    A(Movie Descriptions) --> B("PromptTask: Movie Task 1") --> C("ToolkitTask: Summary Task 1"):::tool --> I("PromptTask: Compare")
    A --> G("PromptTask: Movie Task <i>n</i>" ):::dash  --> H("ToolkitTask: Summary Task <i>n</i>"):::tool-dash
    H --> I
    classDef dash stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    classDef tool stroke:#f06090
    classDef tool-dash stroke:#f06090,stroke-dasharray: 5 5

```

## Import

The two new classes we'll need to import are `ToolkitTask` and `WebScraper`.

**ToolkitTask** is a task just like **PromptTask**, except it allows you to specify the use of Tools. 

**WebScraper** is a specific tool that allows the LLM to scrape the web for information. We'll use this to get a better summary of each movie.

In the top of your application, modify the import statements to include ToolkitTask and WebScraper

```python hl_lines="5-6"
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Griptape 
from griptape.structures import Workflow
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask, ToolkitTask
from griptape.tools import WebScraper

```

## Summary ToolkitTask 

Now we'll add the `ToolkitTask` to the section of our code where we iterate through each movie description.

We will call it the same way we do PromptTask, except the ToolkitTask takes a **list** of **tools**.

```python
summary_task = ToolkitTask(
    "Give me a summary of the movie: {{ }}", 
    tools = [WebScraper()]
    )
```

When we call the `ToolkitTask` we'll need to pass the output of the previous task (the movie_task) to it. There are a few options we can use to do this, depending on the needs of our application.

### Option 1: All Incoming Items
If you recall from the [previous section](04_adding_flexibility.md), using the Jinja Template `{{ parent_outputs.items() }}` will give you a list of dicts from *all incoming tasks*. 
    
Example: 
``` python
    "Give me a summary of the movie: {{ parent_outputs.items() }}"
```

In this case, the return would look something like:
```
Input: Give me a summary of the movie:dict_items([('aff5c7989898483c93a14f40467ec2be',   
'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial')])                                                                         
```

While this works, it does provide a *lot* of extraneous information. We know that there is only one item coming in - so it's not necessary to use this list of dicts. Jinja2 provides filters to reduce this.

### Option 2: Filter for One Item

Jinja2 allows you to use filters to return specific information. The format with Jinja2 is to use a `|` notation to add a filter.

For example, instead of using `{{ parent_outputs.items() }}`, we can filter it to return a `list`, and then also get just the `last` item in the list. That would look like: `{{ parent_outputs.items()|list|last }}`:

```python
    "Give me a summary of the movie: {{ parent_outputs.items()|list|last }}"
```

And the result would be:

```shell
Input: Give me a summary of the movie:('c477e9d08ca546c8b0c4fdc3aa1f7a9e', 'The Princess 
Bride')                                                                                                 
```

This is better, but it still provides more information than we need, as we really just want the movie name.

### Option 3: Use the For Loop

You may recall we're using a Jinja2 for loop (`{% for item in list %}`) structure in our `compare_task`.

We can use the same structure here, even though there's only one item.
```python
"""Give me a summary of the movie:
{% for key, value in parent_outputs.items() %}
{{ value }}
{% endfor %}
"""
```

### Compare all options

As you can see, there are multiple ways to get the result we're looking for. Review the options below to see how they are unique. 

=== "All Items"
    ```python
    # code
    summary_task = ToolkitTask(
        "Give me a summary of the movie: {{ parent_outputs.items() }}",
        tools=[WebScraper()]
        )

    # result
    dict_items([('aff5c7989898483c93a14f40467ec2be', 'The Princess Bride')])                
    ```
=== "Filter For One"
    ```python
    # code
    summary_task = ToolkitTask(
        "Give me a summary of the movie: {{ parent_outputs.items()|list|last }}",
        tools=[WebScraper()]
        )

    # result
    ('c477e9d08ca546c8b0c4fdc3aa1f7a9e', 'The Princess Bride')
    ```
=== "For Loop"
    ```python
    # code
    summary_task = ToolkitTask(
        """
        Give me a summary of the movie:
        {% for key, value in parent_outputs.items() %}
        {{ value }}
        {% endfor %}
        """,
        tools=[WebScraper()]        
        )
    
    # result
    The Princess Bride
    ```

While the third option (using the for loop) is the longest, the result of just the name of the movie is cleanest - so for this example that's what we'll use.

### Add ToolkitTask

Inside the `for description in movie_descriptions:` loop, add the `summary_task` *after* the `movie_task` but *before* the call to the `add_task` method of `workflow.`

```python hl_lines="9-18"
# ...

# Iterate through the movie descriptions
for description in movie_descriptions:
    movie_task = PromptTask(
        "What movie title is this? Return only the movie name: {{ description }} ",
        context={"description": description})
    
    summary_task = ToolkitTask(
        """
        Give me a summary of the movie:
        {% for key, value in parent_outputs.items() %}
        {{ value }}
        {% endfor %}
        """,
        tools=[WebScraper()]
        )
    
    workflow.add_task(movie_task)

# ...
```

## Insert Summary Task

At the moment we've created the Summary Task for each movie, but we haven't inserted them into the workflow.

``` mermaid
graph TB
    A(Movie Descriptions) --> B("PromptTask: Movie Task 1") --> I("PromptTask: Compare")
    C("ToolkitTask: Summary Task 1"):::tool
    H("ToolkitTask: Summary Task <i>n</i>"):::tool-dash
    A --> G("PromptTask: Movie Task <i>n</i>" ):::dash  --> I
    classDef dash stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    classDef tool stroke:#f06090
    classDef tool-dash stroke:#f06090,stroke-dasharray: 5 5

```

To insert them, we'll need to update the `movie_task.add_child` method to call `summary_task` instead of `compare_task`. Then we'll add a call to `summary_task.add_child` to add `compare_task` to it.

Inside the `movie_description` for loop, after `workflow.add_task(movie_task)` modify the code to look like:

```python hl_lines="7 8"
# ...

# Iterate through the movie descriptions
for description in movie_descriptions:
    # ...
    workflow.add_task(movie_task)
    movie_task.add_child(summary_task)
    summary_task.add_child(compare_task)

# ...
```

Now the workflow graph looks like we expect:

``` mermaid
graph TB
    A(Movie Descriptions) --> B("PromptTask: Movie Task 1") --> C("ToolkitTask: Summary Task 1"):::tool --> I("PromptTask: Compare")
    A --> G("PromptTask: Movie Task <i>n</i>" ):::dash  --> H("ToolkitTask: Summary Task <i>n</i>"):::tool-dash
    H --> I
    classDef dash stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    classDef tool stroke:#f06090
    classDef tool-dash stroke:#f06090,stroke-dasharray: 5 5

```

## Handling Rate Limit
You may find through your testing that you run into `RateLimitErrors` where the Rate limit is reached for gpt4 in your org. The messages look something like:

```shell
WARNING:root:<RetryCallState 5541884496: attempt #1; slept for 0.0; last result: 
failed (RateLimitError Rate limit reached for default-gpt-4 in organization 
org-abc123def456 on tokens per min. Limit: 40000 / min. Please try again in 1ms. 
Contact us through our help center at help.openai.com if you continue to have issues.)>
```

This is a specific warning for OpenAI when your organization has hit it's assigned limit rate. You can read more about it in [this article](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6897202-ratelimiterror) by OpenAI.

You can work around this issue by specifically setting the `max_tokens` with the **OpenAIChatPromptDriver**.

### Import OpenAiChatPromptDriver

In your `griptape` input statements at the top of your script, add the following line:

```python
from griptape.drivers import OpenAiChatPromptDriver
```

### Create the driver

Now create a driver object for the OpenAiChatPromptDriver class. Note, you can add this anywhere before your first call to a `PromptTask`. I recommend calling it before `workflow`.

```python
# Define the OpenAiPromptDriver with Max Tokens
driver = OpenAiChatPromptDriver(
    model="gpt-4",
    max_tokens=500 # you can experiment with the number of tokens
)
```

### Update the Tasks

For `compare_task`, `movie_task`, and `summary_task` calls, add the `prompt_driver` parameter.


```python linenums="1" hl_lines="9 20 31"
# ...

compare_task = PromptTask("""
    How are these movies the same:
    {% for key, value in parent_outputs.items() %}
    {{ value }}
    {% endfor %}
    """,
    prompt_driver=driver
    id="compare"
    )

# ...

# Iterate through the movie descriptions
for description in movie_descriptions:
    movie_task = PromptTask(
        "What movie title is this? Return only the movie name: {{ description }} ",
        context={"description": description},
        prompt_driver=driver
        )
    
    summary_task = ToolkitTask(
        """
        Give me a very short summary of the movie from imdb:
        {% for key, value in parent_outputs.items() %}
        {{ value }}
        {% endfor %}
        """,
        tools=[WebScraper()],
        prompt_driver=driver
        )
    
    # ...
```

!!! tip
    Notice we are defining the driver *per task*. This means you can use *different drivers* for each task. You may find that some tasks work absolutely fine with the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model instead of `gpt-4`. Or, if you've trained your own model for a specific task you can use that as well. The possibilities are endless. 


## Test

Execute the code and let's review the output logs.

!!! note
    I've removed the timestamps from the logs to make it easier to read. Yours will most likely still have them.

```bash
INFO Task compare                                  
    Input:                                                                                                  
        How are these movies the same:                                                                      
        The movie "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" is about a troubled child who summons the courage to help a  
    friendly alien escape from Earth and return to his home planet.                                         
        "Jaws" is a movie about a killer shark that unleashes chaos on a beach community off Cape Cod. It's 
    up to a local sheriff, a marine biologist, and an old seafarer to hunt the beast down. The shark        
    terrorizes the community, affecting the number of tourists that usually flock to the island. After many 
    attempts, the shark won't go away, leading the sheriff, the marine biologist, and the seafarer to decide
    to go after the shark and kill it.                                                                      
        The movie "The Princess Bride" is about a bedridden boy's grandfather who reads him the story of a  
    farmboy-turned-pirate. This farmboy encounters numerous obstacles, enemies, and allies in his quest to  
    be reunited with his true love. The movie is known for its satirical humor, great dialogue, and fun     
    adventure scenes. It is whimsical and romantic while also poking fun at the conventions of the fairy    
    tale genre. 

INFO Task compare                                  
    Output: While these three movies, "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial", "Jaws", and "The Princess Bride", seem  
    very different in terms of plot and genre, they do share some similarities. All three films involve a   
    central conflict that requires the main characters to overcome significant challenges. In "E.T.", the   
    child must help the alien return home, in "Jaws", the characters must hunt down a dangerous shark, and  
    in "The Princess Bride", the farmboy-turned-pirate must overcome obstacles to reunite with his love.    
    Each movie also explores themes of courage, friendship, and determination. Furthermore, they are all    
    iconic films that have left a significant impact on popular culture.                                    

```

As you can see, the `compare` task has a lot more detail in it now. We're getting great summaries of the films, and therefore the output is even more detailed and valuable.

!!! info "Experiment"
    You could enhance this output by providing more detail to the prompt compare prompt. For example, instead of just asking how they're the same, some options:

    * "Act as a movie critic. Why are these movies relevant to society?"
    * "Act as a film studies professor. What are common themes in these movies?"

!!! tip "Hot Tip"
    Instead of modifying the prompt, try using **Rules** and **Rulesets** to give your workflow more specific behavior.

    You can learn about Rulesets in the [Multi Persona Chatbot](../chatbot-rulesets/index.md) course.

## Code Review

We added some of helpful functionality in this section, mainly getting wonderful descriptions of these films from the web by using the `WebScraper` tool and `ToolkitTasks`. We also added the use of the `OpenAiChatPromptDriver` to control the `max_tokens` being used.

Review your code.

```python linenums="1" title="app.py" hl_lines="5-7 13-17 35 43 46-55 58-59"
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Griptape 
from griptape.structures import Workflow
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask, ToolkitTask
from griptape.tools import WebScraper
from griptape.drivers import OpenAiChatPromptDriver


# Load environment variables

# Define the OpenAiPromptDriver with Max Tokens
driver = OpenAiChatPromptDriver(
    model="gpt-4",
    max_tokens=500
)

# Create a Workflow
workflow = Workflow()

# Create a list of movie descriptions
movie_descriptions = [
    "A boy discovers an alien in his back yard",
    "A shark attacks a beach",
    "A princess and a man named Wesley"
]

compare_task = PromptTask("""
    How are these movies the same:
    {% for key, value in parent_outputs.items() %}
    {{ value }}
    {% endfor %}

    prompt_driver=driver,
    id="compare")

# Iterate through the movie descriptions

    movie_task = PromptTask(
        "What movie title is this? Return only the movie name: {{ description }} ",
        context={"description": description},
        prompt_driver=driver
        )
    
    summary_task = ToolkitTask(
        """
        Give me a very short summary of the movie from imdb:

        {% endfor %}
        """,
        tools=[WebScraper()],
        prompt_driver=driver
        )
    
    workflow.add_task(movie_task)
    movie_task.add_child(summary_task)
    summary_task.add_child(compare_task)

# Run the workflow
workflow.run()

```

## Next Step
Congratulations, we've got a working movie comparison application! We can add a list of movies to compare, and the result is a detailed comparison that provides valuable insight as to how these movies can impact society.

However, we're currently only viewing the results in the **logs**. If we want to use this data inside an application, we need to get the **output** of the workflow.

In the next section, we'll learn how Workflows handle the output of their tasks and grab just the value of the summary task. Saunter over to [Workflow Outputs](06_workflow_outputs.md) when you're ready.
