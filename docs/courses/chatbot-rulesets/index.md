    In the above video I demonstrate importing `griptape-tools`. This is no longer required. The correct command is simply:

    `pip install griptape`

## Course Description
In this course, we will take a deep dive into creating a command-line interface (CLI) based conversational chatbot with an [Agent](https://docs.griptape.ai/en/latest/griptape-framework/structures/agents/){target="_blank"} using Griptape's [Rulesets](https://docs.griptape.ai/en/latest/griptape-framework/structures/rulesets/){target="_blank"}. Not only will our chatbot be able to engage in conversation, but it will also have the unique ability to embody different personalities, making the interaction more dynamic and interesting. 

You will get hands-on experience working with Griptape, understanding and implementing Rulesets, and using Agents to bring your chatbot to life. This course serves as an excellent introduction to these concepts and technologies.

## Who is this course for?
This course is aimed at **beginners** to **intermediate** level Python developers who are interested in learning more about Griptape.

## Prerequisites
Before beginning this course, you will need:

- An OpenAI API Key (available from [OpenAI's website](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys){target="_blank"})
- Python3.9+ installed on your machine
- An IDE (such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm) to write and manage your code

If you don't have those items available, it's highly recommended you go through the [Griptape Setup - Visual Studio Code](../../setup/index.md) course to set up your environment.

## Course Outline
The course is designed to progressively build your understanding and skillset. We'll start with setting up your environment, then introduce you to the basics of Agents and Rulesets. We'll add more advanced features as the course progresses, including:

- Making your chatbot interactive
- Giving your chatbot a personality
- Enhancing chat aesthetics
- Enabling your chatbot to switch between multiple personas
- And more!

By the end of this course, you'll have a versatile chatbot that can carry on engaging conversations with varying personas, right from your command line.
