"""
Chatbot Agent

This script creates a command line chatbot with various 'identities' it can assume.
The chatbot uses the Griptape library for managing identities and interactions.

An identity is determined by a ruleset, and the chatbot can switch identities based
on user choice. The identities in this example are: 'Kiwi', 'Zelda', and 'Dad'
each with their specific characteristics and conversation styles.

Key Features:
1. Uses Griptape Rulesets and LLMs for a natural chat experience
2. Random identity selection
3. Switch identities simply by asking
4. Exit chat using natural language

Usage:
Run the script and just start chatting
