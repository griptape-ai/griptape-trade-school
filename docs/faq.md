# Frequently Asked Questions

!!! question "What is griptape-tools?"
    Sometimes the videos will mention or demonstrate the installation of `griptape-tools`. 
    
    For example:

    ```shell
    pip install griptape griptape-tools
    ```

    `griptape-tools` is no longer required. It was from an older version of Griptape where the tools were in a separate library. They are incorporated into the main Griptape repo now, so you don't need to install it separately.

    So if you see it, just use:

    ```shell
    pip install griptape
    ```
