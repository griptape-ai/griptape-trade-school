    We believe that the best learning experience is by creating with a clear goal. All our courses are **project-based**, meaning you're applying concepts in real-world scenarios, enhancing your understanding. 
    
-   # Code Snippets
      
    ![img](assets/img/illustrations/workingman2.png)

    How can you learn coding without helpful snippets? We use actual code, with actual line numbers, highlighting changes as you work your way through the class.

    ```python linenums="1"
    # Run an agent
    agent.run("Teach me Griptape!")
    ```

-   # Text, Video, Whatever

    Some concepts are taught best through text. Others through video. And still others require both.
    
    We're happy to provide all of it!
